# Improve audio signals with noise reduction techniques

FABADA is a non-parametric noise reduction technique based on Bayesian
inference that iteratively evaluates possibles moothed  models  of
the  data introduced,  obtaining  an  estimation  of the  underlying
signal that is statistically  compatible  with the  noisy  measurements.
